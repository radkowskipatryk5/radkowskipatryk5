Hi, I’m Patryk Radkowski. Currently there is not much to see there, but in next months (after my school graduation) I finnaly want to fill this place with various programms I wrote.

Mostly I'm programming in Python, but as you can think I tried writting in other languages like: PHP, JavaScript, C++ and HTML/CSS.

I'm more fronend person, I love making apps/websites more convinent to the user.

Now the next thing to learn for me is React and ReactNative.

You can reach me on Facebook and Discord
